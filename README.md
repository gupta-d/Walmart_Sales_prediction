This dataset is taken from Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/).
Walmart has challanged the participants to predict the weekly sales of their 45 stores during Nov'12 - July'18 period. They provided historical data for a period of Feb'10 to Nov'12 to establish a model and upload the results to get the score against actual actual sales data. The challange has a bit of added complexity due to lots of missing data for markdowns during special holiday periods.

`'Mean Absolute Error'` has been used as the performance metric to evaluate the performance
